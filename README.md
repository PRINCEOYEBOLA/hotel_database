# hotel_database
A project to create a database for aa hotel to keep record of their users
I created an app called management, which handles the models.py and views.py and templates for the necessary html.
In the models.py a table called Record was created.
Created a registration page for the management to be able to add new user using the following parameters: occupant_name, occupant_email, occupant_work
amount_paid, room_number, Number of Nights, Start Date, End Date.
There is a requirements.txt containing the packages used in this project
